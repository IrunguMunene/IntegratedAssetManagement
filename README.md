# IntegratedAssetManagement

The integrated asset management system was initially developed to keep track of a members organization assets. However, I have adapted the idea into a library management system. The app is initially being developed for a local church as part of giving back to society. However I have changed the name of the church to the name of my private company name for purposes of show casing my skills.

The system is developed using ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC, Entity Framework Core 3.1 and Microsoft SQL Server for the database. If your SQL name is not the default Instance change the Connection string in appsettings.json to what is relevant for your environment.

This is still work in progress but show cases the basic functionality the system will have once completed.
